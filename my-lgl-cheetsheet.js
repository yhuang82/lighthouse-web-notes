A programming token is the basic component of source code. 
Characters are categorized as one of five classes of tokens that describe their functions

/* 3. expression:
In programming, an expression is a combination of values, variables, operators,

Expressions can represent a wide range of computations, 
from simple arithmetic calculations to complex operations involving functions, conditional logic, and more.
